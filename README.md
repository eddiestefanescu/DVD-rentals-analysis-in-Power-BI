# DVD Rentals Analysis in Power BI
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
## Overview
The objective of this project is to analyze the internal data of a fictional small-business called “Infinity DVD Rentals” using Power BI Desktop. 
In this project a wide range of techniques was employed including:
- Importing tables from PostgreSQL
- Transforming and shaping data in the back-end Query Editor
- Generating data models by properly linking multiple tables based on PKs and FKs
- Creating Calculated Columns and Measures via DAX syntax
- Generating visuals that dynamically respond to slicers and filters
- Applying logic to extract valuable insight from the data

## Resources Employed
The data was obtained from Pierian Training part of a [paid course on SQL](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-sql-bootcamp/) offered on the Udemy platform.

For simplicity, the tables are provided here in a CSV format. 

Power BI Desktop Version: 2.118.828.0 64-bit (June 2023)

## Brief Description of Results
The PowerBI report contains three distinct pages:
- Executive dashboard
- Customer detail
- Geographical detail

One could argue that the report could’ve also included a film detail page as well as an actor detail page. However, for the purpose of this brief demo the three pages discussed should suffice.
