# DVD Rentals Analysis in Power BI
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
## Overview
The objective of this project is to analyze the internal data of a fictional company called “Infinity DVD Rentals” using Power BI Desktop. 
In this project I employed a vast range of techniques that included:
- Importing tables from PostgreSQL
- Transforming and shaping data in the back end Query Editor
- Generating data models by properly linking multiple tables based on PKs and FKs
- Creating Calculated Columns and Measures via DAX syntax
- Generating eye-catching visuals that dynamically respond to slicers and filters
- Applying logic to extract valuable insight from the data
